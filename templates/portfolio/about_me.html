                Hello! My name is Britney Philpot, I have 36 years old and from a small town in Oklahoma. I started my journey with Full Stack Development in 2025 by attending San Diego Global Knowledge University. This was definitely a hidden passion that I have enjoyed learning more about. I love making websites look and feel like they were made to catch your eye and leave you in awe. This for me has been an incredible learning experience and I hope that, with the skills I've learned, I am more than able to build amazing webpages for clients.
